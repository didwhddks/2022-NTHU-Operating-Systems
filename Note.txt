1. The death of CPU scaling
2. Heterogeneous computing
3. nonvolatile main memory
4. shell CLI
5. parameter marshaling
6. remote procedure calls cannot be passed by reference and pointer.
reason 1: memory的boundary不容易去判斷
reason 2: 指到的memory的size可能很大，不符合RPC的功能。
7. threading model
8. pthread_create is a non-blocking code.
9. pthread_join is a blocking code.
10. MMU has two memory registers: base register and length register.
11. library not found - dynamic binding
12. segmentation 比較符合user view，而paging比較好操作memory.
13. data locality program access a specific region of memory in a period of time : for loop
14. disadvantage of dynamic linking: runntime overhead、在run time才bind address，如果address錯就完蛋了

set memory or access memory are not privilleged 
instructions. But load base and limit register is privilleged
instructions.

期中考考到chapter 9

preemptive + disable interrupt (kernel design)
context switch: dispatcher

DMA I/O method needs to bypass CPU
physical memory address rather than virtual memory address
